# Creative programming 🎨

A beginner workshop - painting with JavaScript. We'll be using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to create visual art. P5 is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to draw shapes and create animations. It's a great way to learn programming concepts by creating something visual.

## 👩🏻‍🎨 Who this is for:

- People who are new to programming or have never done any before.
- Designers, artists, and other creatives who want to learn how to code.
- Experienced programmers who want to get in touch with their creative side.

## 💻 What you'll need:

- A laptop with a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- That's it!

## 📚 What we'll cover:

We'll be covering the very basics of programming with p5.js:

- creating a canvas
- basic geometry shapes
- mouse and keyboard interaction
- animation
- randomness
- creating your paint application and brushes

## 🎨 What you'll create:

As new concepts are introduced, you'll be given a chance to experiment and create your own art. By the end of the workshop, you'll have created multiple pieces of art and your own paint application.
